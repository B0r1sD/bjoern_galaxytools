The Jeff glad to see things are going well and business is starting to pick up

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:19,920
Andrew told me about your outstanding numbers on Tuesday keep up the good work

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Now to other business I am gonna suggest a payment schedule

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,200
for outstanding money that is due

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,440
One can you pay the balance of the license agreement

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,080
as soon as possible?

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,560
Two I suggest we set up or you suggest what you can pay on the back

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Rawties

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,680
What do you feel comfortable with?

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,440
Paying

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,720
Every two weeks

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,240
Every month

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,960
I would like to keep

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,800
I would like to catch up

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,960
and maintain current rawties

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,160
So if we can start current rawties

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
and maintain them

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,800
Every two weeks as all stores are required to do

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,960

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,000
